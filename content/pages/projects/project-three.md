  I helped Prism, an early-stage music fintech startup, kickstart its design ops
  and design language system for exponential year-over-year growth.

## Prism is an event booking platform for talent buyers and promoters.

As an early-stage startup, the company hadn’t yet developed a cohesive design system or implemented processes for the creation, documentation, and use of design patterns and principles.

No standardized processes or documentation meant a lack of consistency in design patterns and front-end frameworks. It also meant no source of truth or historical record for how those decisions were made. Additionally, despite being a relatively young startup, its software was loaded with features and complex functionality for many user types and roles, amplifying the need for these design ops improvements.

As the company’s first designer, solving this was one of my earliest responsibilities. I collaborated with Prism’s product leadership and dev teams to lay the groundwork for a design system capable of meeting the needs of users and team members, as well as new processes and workflows based on current best practices for product teams.
