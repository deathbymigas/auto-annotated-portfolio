  funding.

## Onramp Funds is a startup providing cash advance loans to SMB ecommerce sellers.

As a new player in this lending space, it was important to optimize registration and onboarding workflows to eliminate dropoff and user churn. I worked with Onramp stakeholders to design a first-time user lending workflow to meet these goals.

The result is a redesigned onboarding and registration workflow that eliminates existing friction points while leveraging design psychology principles to create emotional incentives for new users to complete the signup process.

**BEFORE:** The legacy onboarding experience was form-heavy, often asking for duplicate information from one screen to the next. This experience didn’t do the best job of communicating how much or what type of information would be required, or where the user was in the process.

**AFTER:** Redesigned onboarding and registration experience using updated design language.

## The process, in a nutshell:

*   Collaborate with Onramp stakeholders to understand user & business needs, pain points, and requirements.

*   Review existing documentation and audit current experience to understand UX, technical, and legal constraints.

*   Synthesize findings and propose updates to onboarding flows and design language system.

The initial onboarding experience was form-heavy and lacked a modern look and feel. I worked with Onramp to rethink this signup flow from start to finish, as seen here.

## Friction vs. Incentives

Essentially, there are two ways to streamline new user onboarding: reduce friction, or introduce incentives for users to continue forward. I identified several opportunities to reduce the number of form fields overall and create a more intuitive task flow.

Once we aligned on this streamlined experienced, I looked at ways to further reduce the emotional friction associated with these types of onboarding and registration experiences.

We redesigned the UI to have a friendlier, more modern look and feel, including “oversized” components and input selectors that felt less intimidating and more conversational. In this spirit, input prompts were rewritten as questions, inspired by chatbot-style onboarding.

Mobile views highlighting some “friendlier” components and input requirements rewritten as questions. As you can see, there’s a lot of legal and business jargon inherent in the registration process, but these were required by law. The progress bar at the bottom of the screen uses a psychological principle called the endowed progress effect — more on that later.

I also looked at ways to create completion incentives to nudge users towards continuing the onboarding process, including gamification techniques and concepts borrowed from cognitive psychology and behavioral economics. *Yeah, yeah*, I know — stop me if you’ve heard this one before, but I actually enjoy nerding out on this stuff.

Another example client deliverable in Figma. Here you can see a systems diagram of the legacy and proposed onboarding flows, along with potential completion incentives for onboarding users.

Depending on a prospective customer’s business type, verification requirements, and other input, there could be few or many steps required at each stage of the process. Given this complexity, it was clear that the flow would need to be chunked into a series of dynamic steps.

I designed an indeterminate progress indicator to maintain a sense of place and progress throughout, creating a sense of achievement each time the user advances to the next step in the onboarding funnel. This is often known as the [endowed progress effect](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/500480).

## Here’s the redesigned onboarding flow:

## Design System and Documentation

While designing this workflow, I was also tasked with updating the product’s design system, from the component level up to information architecture and page hierarchy. That meant a lot of thinking about navigation, modals, and how to progressively display information in the appropriate context. It also meant creating and documenting these rules so that they could be understood and repeated when appropriate.

## Outcome

The redesigned onboarding experience launched in September 2021, and early feedback was overwhelmingly encouraging. The new design system was well-received by the development team and has allowed them to move quickly and efficiently through several product cycles and product updates, with the company ultimately [securing over $45 million in funding to date](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/onramp-funds).
