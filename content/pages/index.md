      ## I’m a Portland-based designer with a range of experience from startups
      to enterprise, and from healthcare to edtech.


      I grew up in a small town on the Texas-Louisiana border and eventually
      became the first member of my family to pursue a college degree. There
      wasn’t much to do when I was a kid, so I taught myself HTML, CSS, and
      Photoshop. Back then, I would sketch wireframes on notebook paper and code
      websites from scratch in Microsoft Notepad. What can I say? It was the
      nineties and I wasn’t good at sports. Most CSS was inline and JavaScript
      was primarily seen as a Flash competitor. We furiously typed out markup in
      Notepad, and we were proud of it.


      My first job out of college was as a copywriter for a nonprofit
      organization in San Antonio, although I probably spent as much time
      designing and coding custom email templates as I did writing copy for
      them. After that, I spent a few years doing content and digital strategy
      for a San Antonio-based creative agency while transitioning to UX full
      time.


      Like a lot of designers, I prefer a data-informed approach to my work,
      leveraging both qualitative and quantitative research and analytics to
      create everything from design systems to web apps and native mobile
      experiences.


      Outside of work, I enjoy good food, music, and sci fi, spending time in
      nature, and going on hikes with Olivia, my nine-year old Australian
      shepherd. She’s great.


      I value mission-driven projects and organizations and typically pursue
      opportunities where I believe my skills can lead to real, measurable
      outcomes for real people. If that resonates with you, let’s get in touch,
      even if it’s just to say hi.
